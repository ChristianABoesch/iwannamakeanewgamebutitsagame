I now have a decent draft of this new idea to use as a first commit for GitHub. Hooray. Obviously I'm looking for this to be more entertaining than it currently is, because as much as the mechanics work, it's just ... so mundane. I need to change that. I need to generate some ideas. Matter of fact, I literally can with the help of Q. I can't remember if I've used Q for help with ideas in the past, but I've certainly used Cursor to perform this task in the time I'd spent working exclusively with it. But I wanna see what Q would have in mind for me to make this game even cooler. I have a feeling I'll get similar suggestions to what I'd gotten before when I completed a draft with decent gameplay and mechanics. If I had to make exactly two predictions, I'd say it would recommend a change in the background as well as music and sounds whose volumes the player can control. These would not be bad changes to make, and I believe these to be the same two that come up each time. So I'll definitely ask and see if those come up. Other than that, I'm actually not sure what else this game needs. Although I have pondered having the actual game be zoomed in so that the more the player moves in the right direction, one of the map points can just appear. That way it'll be kind of like a fun surprise or something. If there was a way to do that, I'd love to take a crack at it. I'll figure out a way to ask Q to do this for me, if I can convey it all correctly. I think how I wrote it just now isn't such a bad way, but I guess we'll see if that does the trick. Also, fun fact: this idea started out as just a series of pages you would navigate between to learn all the ways you could design a basic game. Essentially you're just pressing buttons and reading information, but I wanted to turn that into an actual gameplay thing where you're playing a game about making a game. I thought it'd be worthwhile to have an actual game element tied together with reading useful information about how to get started making them. So that explains why the name of this repo is "I wanna make a new game but it's a game". That's why. The last project was just called "I wanna make a new game", with no means of already having a game. I think this is much better and certainly more playable.
